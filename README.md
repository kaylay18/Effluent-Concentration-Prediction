# Effluent Concentration Prediction App
## About
The purpose of this app is to predict effluent electrical conductivity, which is a good measure for indutries to evaluate and improve the quality of water in order to preserve the environment and protect public health. It's important that the wastewater that is returned to the water cycle is free of harmful pollutants and this metric allows us to determine if a treatment is effective. Although measuring electrical conductivity alone does not indicate the exact concentrations of ions in the water, it gives a broad overview on if there are pollutants in the water and if it is safe. Wastewater treatment plants can utilize this tool to determine if their water treatement is effective and can adjust and optimize their treatment plans accordingly.
## Usage
This app can be run through huggingface (https://huggingface.co/spaces/kaylayi18/EffluentConcentration). The required libraries are listed in the requirement.txt file. The user inputs various parameters and the model predicts the electrical conductivity of the effluent from these inputs. The user can then compare that prediction with the safe/unsafe EC ranges listed below the prediction to determine if treatment was effective and sufficient. The app also includes Deon's checklist and the ethics datacard that discusses and addresses several ethical considerations and concerns at the bottom of the app.
## Description
This repository includes the data preprocessing in google colab, the best/trained machine learning model, and Deon's checklist. The best model identified from training multiple machine learning models is KNN. The datasource for this project is from the Manresa Wastewater Treatment Plant collected from https://github.com/amroohi/Predict-wastewater, other acknowledgements and references are included in this repository as well.
